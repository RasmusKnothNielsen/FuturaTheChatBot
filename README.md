# Futura The ChatBot
This repo contains a little side project where I play with an implementation of [ELIZA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA) and combining it with a discord bot functionality.

Besides offering therapeutic consultation, Futura can also help with the following:

- Provide you with good vibes in the form of friday songs.
- Help you with Google results.
- Tell you what week we currently are in. (Which is notoriously hard)

Remember to alter the config.json file, to reflect your own Discord Bot Key:

```
{
    "prefix": [YourChosenPrefix],
    "token": [PastYourTokenHere]
}
```
